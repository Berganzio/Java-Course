Sorting algorithms

Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange a list of items in a particular order. 

Selection sort algorithm

Example steps:
1. start at index 0
2. find the smallest element in the list
3. swap the smallest element with the element at index 0
4. move to index + 1
5. repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the end of the list

You can notice that in this algorithm there's not for loop. Instead, we use a while loop
to keep repeating the same steps while the input is NOT empty.



Bubble sort algorithm

Example steps:
1. start at index 0
2. compare element at index 0 with element at index 1
3. if element at index 0 is bigger than element at index 1, swap them
4. move to index + 1
5. repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the end of the list
